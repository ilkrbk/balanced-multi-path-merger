# Balanced multi-path merger

### Go to

```
./PA_LR1.2/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/index.txt
```

Enter numbers

```
10
8
2
1
29
3
```
Result file 

```
./PA_LR1.2/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/b/b1.txt
```

### Example

Now I will give an example of this algorithm on a small array

```
| 3 | 5 | 1 | 10 | 12 | 6 | 4 | 15 | 11 | 9 | 7 | 13 | 14 | 2 | 8 |
```

First you need to split this whole file into three

```
| 3 | 10 | 4 | 9 | 14 |
| 5 | 12 | 15 | 7 | 2 |
| 1 | 6 | 11 | 13 | 8 |
```

Then from each file it is necessary to take on the first, second,â€¦ fifth element to sort them and to add in the following files and at the end to delete these files.

```
| 1 | 3 | 5 || 7 | 9 | 13 |
| 6 | 10 | 12 || 2 | 8 | 14 |
| 4 | 11 | 15 ||  |  |  |    
```

We also take the first series, the second, and repeat these operations until there is one file with one series

```
| 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 15
| 2 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 13 | 14
```

```
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
```

### Run the program
